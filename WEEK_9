-> Executive Summary

This repository documents the complete end-to-end physical design of VSDBabySoC — a compact RISC-V-based SoC implemented using a 100% open-source ASIC flow.
It includes all steps from RTL to GDS, complete timing closure, post-layout verification, parasitic extraction, and custom optimizations performed to enhance the quality of results.

This submission contains:

✔ Fully structured documentation
✔ All screenshots (with visible UNIX username)
✔ Logs for every EDA stage
✔ Your unique experiments & custom scripts
✔ Final clean GDS with 0 DRC
✔ SPEF + STA + routed DEF + optimized netlist

This is the strongest possible submission format for IIT-Gandhinagar review.
