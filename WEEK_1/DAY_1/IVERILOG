//iverilog Simulation Workflow

//Steps Performed

🎗️Switched to root user using su.

1) Navigated to project directory:

    /home/vsd/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files


2) Verified the available files using ls. Found:

    Design file → good_mux.v
    
    Testbench file → tb_good_mux.v


3) Compiled design + testbench with Icarus Verilog:

    iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v  
    
    → Output executable: a.out


4) Ran the simulation:

    ./a.out
    → Generated waveform file: tb_good_mux.vcd


5) Opened waveform in GTKWave:

    gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
